/**
 * Plugin Name:       CloudGround
 * Description:       The CloudGround site's content and composition: the business's facts, the Elementor widgets for the parts of the site that have data or behaviour, the dynamic tags and the Kit. The theme draws; this plugin remembers and composes.
 * Version:           0.1.0
 * Requires at least: 6.6
 * Requires PHP:      8.2
 * Requires Plugins:  elementor
 * License:           GPL-2.0-or-later
 * Text Domain:       cloudground
 *
 * Content lives here and not in the theme, because changing theme must not take the
 * site's content with it.
 *
 * ## What is a widget of this plugin, and what is not
 *
 * The words and pictures of a page are Elementor's own widgets — Heading, Text Editor,
 * Image — inside containers that carry the theme's classes: they are written, replaced and
 * moved in the editor like anything else. A widget of this plugin exists only where there
 * is data or behaviour. Its render() prints the theme's template part, every sentence it
 * prints is a field, and an empty field says what the site says in that language.
