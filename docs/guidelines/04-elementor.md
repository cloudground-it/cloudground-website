## Native first: the decision

Before building anything, ask **what the section is made of**:

| It is… | Build it with |
|---|---|
| headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, links | **native widgets** in a container with the theme's classes |
| a fact that lives in the settings (address, phone, hours) | a native widget with a **dynamic tag** (`CloudGround → Fact`, `Contact link`) |
| a query (latest posts, services, a gallery of a post type) | a **plugin widget** |
| behaviour a script drives (slider, map, form, counter) | a **plugin widget** |
| another plugin's output (booking form, reviews) | a **plugin widget** that prints the theme's override of it |

**If you are adding a control that answers "how should it look", stop.** A widget's
controls answer "which content"; the look is the stylesheet's.

## Building a native section

- **The container carries the theme's classes** in *Advanced → CSS Classes*, for example
  `sheet sheet--dark on-dark`, with a container inside it carrying `measure`.
- **Each widget carries the class that dresses it**: `display` for a headline,
  `eyebrow` for a label, `prose` for a paragraph.
- **The plugin's `assets/elementor.css` makes Elementor's wrappers transparent** (block,
  full width, no padding, no gap), at the weight of one class (`:where(.elementor) .e-con`).
  - A container with no theme class is invisible.
  - A container with a class is exactly what the class says.
- **A native Heading inherits** its font, size, colour and spacing from its wrapper, so
  `display` on the widget is enough. Without that rule the `<h2>` inside is the browser's
  default size.
- **Measure and margins go through variables.** Elementor holds every widget to
  `max-width: 100%` and zero margins, at a weight no class reaches. So a theme class that
  sets a width or a margin says it twice:

  ```css
  .prose { max-width: 62ch; --cloudground-max: 62ch; }
  .eyebrow { margin-bottom: 1rem; --cloudground-margin: 0 0 1rem; }
  ```

  Forgetting the variable is the most common reason a native section "loses its spacing".
- **Reveal on scroll:** add `cloudground-reveal` to the container whose widgets should come in
  one after the other.
- **Photographs in a frame:** Elementor's `.elementor img { height: auto }` beats a
  theme's `height: 100%`. Restate the theme's rule in the plugin's `elementor.css` at a
  higher specificity, naming the component only to stop Elementor changing it.

## A plugin widget

All the behaviour is in one base class, `Cloudground_Section`; each widget is data in
`cloudground_elementor_sections()`.
- **One class per widget.** Elementor rebuilds widgets with `new $class($data, $args)`, so
  a single class configured in its constructor is a TypeError. Each widget is one line:
  `class Cloudground_Section_Contact extends Cloudground_Section { protected const SECTION = 'contact'; }`.
- **`render()` prints the theme's template part**, with the widget's settings as `$args`.
- **Every sentence the part prints is a field** (`texts` in the spec):
  - its default is the site's words in the language of the document being edited;
  - an empty field says the site's words;
  - `{name}` and the other placeholders become the facts.
- **`content_template()` is empty.** The editor always asks the server, so the part has
  one implementation. It is slower to drag, and correct.
- **`get_style_depends()` returns `[]`.** The part's CSS is in the page's bundle.
- **Control types in the spec are strings** (`'switcher'`, `'select'`), not
  `Controls_Manager` constants: the theme reads the spec on every page, Elementor loaded
  or not.

The `.claude/skills/elementor-widget` skill walks through adding one.

## Dynamic tags

- **The facts are dynamic tags** in the plugin's group: a text fact, and a link (call,
  write, map).
- **Use them in native widgets** wherever the page shows a fact, so the fact changes in one
  place.
- **Add a fact** to `cloudground_fact_fields()` and it becomes a choice in both tags.

## The Kit

- **Written from `tokens.json`** by `cloudground_apply_kit()`: the global colours and fonts, so a
  native widget *can* wear them. Nothing is applied by default.
- **Google Fonts stay off.** Fonts are served by the site; fetching them from Google hands
  every visitor's IP address to a third party.
- **Re-run it** with `wp cloudground kit` after changing tokens.json.

## Theme Builder (Elementor Pro)

- Declare `add_theme_support('elementor-pro')` and register the core locations.
- The theme's templates call `cloudground_location('header' | 'footer' | 'single' | 'archive')`
  first and print their own markup only when nothing was printed.
- **Per language:** see [05 · Words and languages](05-words-and-languages.md#theme-builder-documents).
- **Without Pro nothing breaks.** Every Pro-only path is behind `function_exists`.

## The editor must show everything

- **Nothing is held back in the preview**, so every section is visible while editing:
  `html.editing` instead of `html.motion`.
- **Anything a script sets up is set up again** when Elementor redraws an element
  (`frontend/element_ready/global`).
- **A section that hides itself when empty** (no reviews yet, no posts yet) stays visible
  in the editor (`html:not(.editing)` in its hiding rule), so its words can still be
  edited.
- **`tests/e2e/editor-preview.mjs` checks this**, and belongs in every project.
