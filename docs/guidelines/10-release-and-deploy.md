# 10 · Release and deploy

## Versions

- **The theme and the plugin share one version number.** It appears in three places:
  - `style.css` (`Version:`);
  - the plugin header (`* Version:`);
  - `CLOUDGROUND_VERSION`.

  `bin/build-zips` refuses to run when these disagree.
- **Semantic versioning:**
  - patch for fixes;
  - minor for new features;
  - major when something a site relies on changes (a filter, a template's variables, an
    option's shape).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**, newest first, in the form `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD`. Each entry says
  what changed for the people who run the site, in plain words, with a bold lead.

## Building

```sh
bin/build-zips      # dist/cloudground-theme-<v>.zip and dist/cloudground-plugin-<v>.zip
```

- **The theme zip carries the built `assets/dist` and its manifest**, and not the sources,
  `node_modules`, or Vite's config.
- **The plugin zip carries no tests.**
- **`*.zip` is ignored by git.** Releases live on GitHub, and a commercial plugin's zip
  (Elementor Pro) carries a licence.

## Releasing

1. Update the version in the three places and write the changelog entry.
2. Commit, then push.
3. Build the zips.
4. `gh release create v<x.y.z> dist/*.zip --notes-file <the changelog entry>`.

**The release notes say what to install**, including which version of each companion plugin
the release was tested with.

## Deploying (WordPress over SSH)

**Prerequisites:**
- an SSH key for the server's site user;
- WP-CLI on the server.

**Run WP-CLI remotely** through a small wrapper that filters PHP deprecation noise:

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key> <user>@<host> "cd ~/htdocs/<site> && wp $*"
```

**Steps:**

1. Upload the zips to a private folder on the server (`chmod 700`), never inside the web
   root.
2. Install them, replacing the current version:
   ```sh
   wp plugin install /path/cloudground-plugin-<v>.zip --force
   wp theme install  /path/cloudground-theme-<v>.zip --force
   ```
3. Run what the release needs:
   - `wp cloudground kit` when tokens.json changed;
   - a migration command when data changed;
   - `wp rewrite flush` when routes changed.
4. `wp cache flush`. Purge the page cache (Varnish, a CDN) too if there is one.
5. Delete the uploaded files from the server.

## Checking production (read-only)

- **Every kind of page answers 200** in every language. The 404 answers 404.
- **Each page's words, canonical and `hreflang`** are right.
- **Pages that should not be indexed** carry `noindex`, and are not in the sitemap.
- **The stylesheet and the scripts load**, with no console errors.
- **What the release changed** is visible.

**Never:**
- submit a form;
- send an email;
- create a test record on production.

Use a fake token to see a "link not valid" page. Use a headless browser for screenshots.

**If an analytics service is on the site:**
- remember automated browsers may be ignored;
- your test visits count;
- test Firefox and Safari as well as Chrome.

## Access

- **SSH keys, not passwords.** Remove the deploy key from the server when the work is done.
- **Credentials live in a file outside git** and are never written into docs, commits or
  conversations.
- **Admin accounts for the people who run the site** get their own users, never a shared
  one.
